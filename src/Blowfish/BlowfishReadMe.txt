The README file for Visual Basic Blowfish functions

This is a Visual Basic version of Bruce Schneier's Blowfish algorithm
as detailed in "Applied Cryptography", 2nd edition, 1996

It has been tested in VB6 and Access VBA. Use at your own risk.

Version 6. Published 20 November 2003. History at end.

There are 11 VB modules and two VB projects.

The main modules are:

1.  basBlowfishByteFns: the (new) main wrapper fns you will call in your programs
2.  basBlowfishFileFns: wrapper functions for file encryption
3.  basBlowfish: the actual Blowfish algorithm in Visual Basic
4.  basBlfArrays: the blowfish S and P arrays
5.  basUnsignedWord: utilities for unsigned word operations
6.  basConvert: conversion utilities for byte-strings-hex-word 
7.  basFileAPI: wrapper fns to read and write files using Windows API
    functions (these work better than VB's standard Open and Put fns).
8.  basRadix64: functions to encode binary strings to base64 format
    and vice versa (aka radix64, Transfer Encoding, Printable Encoding).

These modules that contain test functions:
9.  basTestBlowfish: examples of Blowfish use and a test suite
10. basTestRadix64: examples of base64/radix64 encoding and decoding
11. basAPITimer: Timer functions by Litwin, Getz, Gilbert.

Two VB Projects:
Blowfish.vbp:   Demo of simple Blowfish encryption
BlowfishEx.vbp: Extended demo showing ECB and CBC modes

Plus three text files to use in testing the file encryption functions:
hello.txt, nowis.txt, sonnets.txt.

To use:

Add the files to your VB project or import them into modules in Access.

Main ECB functions for variable length data
-------------------------------------------
blf_BytesEnc(abData): Enciphers byte array abData with current key and padding
blf_BytesDec(abData): Deciphers byte array abData with current key and padding
blf_BytesRaw(abData, bEncrypt): En/Deciphers abData without padding
blf_FileEnc(sFileIn, sFileOut): Enciphers file with name sFileIn
   with current key and writes output to new file sFileOut
blf_FileDec(sFileIn, sFileOut): Deciphers file with name sFileIn
   with current key and writes output to new file sFileOut

To set the current key, call blf_KeyInit(aKey())
   where aKey() is the key as an array of Bytes.
   
CBC Functions
-------------
blf_BytesEncCBC
blf_BytesDecCBC
blf_BytesEncRawCBC
blf_BytesDecRawCBC
blf_FileEncCBC
blf_FileDecCBC

Note that the FilexCBC functions require the Initialisation Vector
as a hex string, but the BytesxCBC functions require it as a byte array.
This is for historical reasons.

Padding
-------
The padding technique is as described in PKCS#5/RFC2630/RFC3370.
If you don't want padding, use the 'Raw' versions.
PadBytes(abData):   Returns padded byte array.
UnpadBytes(abData): Returns unpadded byte array.

Basic functions in basBlowfish
------------------------------------
blf_KeyInit(abKey): Sets current key with contents of abKey
blf_Key: [redundant]
blf_Initialise(aKey, nKeyBytes): Sets current key of nKeyBytes length.
blf_EncryptBytes(aBytes): Encrypts 8-byte block with current key.
blf_DecryptBytes(aBytes): Decrypts 8-byte block with current key.

Class Modules: It is a trivial exercise to convert these functions
to class modules. Please feel free to do so, but please keep the
copyright notice intact if you do.

Modification history
--------------------
20 October 2000: Version 1 first published.
=============================================
16 November 2000: Version 2:
 	Added new module basBlowfishCBC with CBC variants
	of main wrapper functions.
	Changed En(De)CryptBytes fns from private to public
	Changed name of bu_Str2Bytes to bu_HexStr2Bytes
	Ditto bu_Str2Words to bu_HexStr2Words
	Added new byte utility fns:
	bu_XorBytes
	bu_CopyBytes
	bu_Bytes2String
	bu_String2Bytes
	Added CBC tests to basTestBlowfish
=============================================
28 December 2000: Version 3:
  Added Radix64 functions and
  improved functionality of demo form.
  Improved (!) legalise in copyright notice.
  New base64/radix64 functions are:
  EncodeStr64 - encodes string of binary chars to radix 64 format.
   - does not add CRLFs or any other formatting.
  DecodeStr64 - decodes radix64 chars back to binary string.
   - ignores any non-radix64 characters.
=============================================
20 January 2001: Version 3a:
	Minor bug fix to demo project form frmBlowfish.frm.
	If ciphertext ends with an acsii zero and is then stored directly
	in a VB text box, the text box truncates the trailing zeroes.
	Changed code behind form to store ciphertext in a string instead.
	Thanks to Jim McCusker of epotec.com for this fix.
==============================================
12 May 2001: Version 4:
	Various minor improvements.
	Thanks to Doug J Ward for his suggestions and advice on improving
	the speed of some of the byte operations and for much improved
	ShiftLeft and ShiftRight functions used in basRadix64.
	Thanks also to Robert Garofalo for pointing out an error in
	the max length of the blowfish key and a fix in error handling.
==============================================
27 January 2002: Version 5:
	Major re-write.
	Improved internal Blowfish word manipulation functions.
	Major speed improvements to string encryption functions
	(with many thanks to Robert Garofalo for suggestions
	incorporated here).
	Replaced old-style byte conversion routines in basByteUtils
	with dynamic array versions in basConvert
==============================================
20 November 2003: Version 6:
	Replaced deprecated 'String' functions with 'Byte' versions.
	Added 'Byte' functions and error handling to basRadix64.
	Updated basConvert with error handling.
==============================================
